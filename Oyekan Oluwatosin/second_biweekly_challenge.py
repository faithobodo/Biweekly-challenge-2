# ### Write a python program that prompts for inputs from the user. The inputs should be the user's name and the age.

# In[4]:


# declare user's name and age input

user_name= str(input())
age = int(input())


# In[6]:


# Print the user’s name and age


# concatinate the strings and input
print('Hello ' + user_name + ',' + ' you are ' + str(age) + ' years old')


# In[7]:


# Calculate the user’s DOB using the age and print to screen

# creating the user_DOB function
year = 2020
user_DOB = year - age

# printing the output
print('Your year of birth is ' + str(user_DOB ))


# In[8]:


# State which age group the user belongs to

# Legend
# Infants: <1
# Children: 1-11 years
# Teens: 12-17 
# Adults: 18-64
# Older Adults: 65+
